* Initial set up of neural net, based on leNet-5, no signal out, 
    most likely due to using unprocessed data.
* The data is very padded, this has been reduced with the function
    ``cropHeart(inp)``, but I will need to make sure all the files are the same
    size before they get fed into the CNN.
* I could try normalising the data to get a signal, but will need to get the 
    unpadded data working first.
